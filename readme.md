##Betrayal at House on the Hill Helper
by Daniel Xiao

Built using Semantic UI, CSS, HTML, JQuery. Edited in Sublime Text. 

This is a companion app for the board game [Betrayal at House on the Hill](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill).

To use this, you can optionally enter a player name and then select one of the 12 characters. Any characters of a color selected will make the other character unselectable. When finished, click add player and it should be added to the list.

Each character has four stats that you can add or subtract. The default stat will be automatically selected and will be displayed in green. You can click on the name to minimize the player. You can click the x on the top right to remove this player from the game, this will allow you to select that color character again from the dropdown.

Thanks!

Future features?:
-player reordering
-dice roller
-character information (birthday, age, etc)
